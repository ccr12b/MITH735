# Bienvenue! Welcome to my project website!

## **What is this for?**
This is a website created in accordance with course objects for a graduate level digital humnanities course through **MITH** (Maryland Institute of Technology in the Humanities) at the The University of Maryland-College Park. As graduate students in the course we are learning about the creating of simple sites through the use of Atom and GitHub. Students were split into two groups of three. These two groups are for collaboration and accountability purposes.
