# **Research Proposal : *La Danseuse Mobile***

**Topic & Research**
--------------------
Sidonie Gabrielle Collette was a French writer, dancer, mime, actress, and journalist during the Belle Époque era of France.
Colette is most widely celebrated for her auto-fictional novels such as the *Claudine* series and *The Vagabond*.
Outside of her accomplishments as a writer and a dancer, what makes Colette most notable for her time was her mobility in society; meaning her freeness to walk the streets of Paris.
During the post-Haussmanisation renovation period, Paris still saw the effects gender segregation in public spaces.
However, Colette was part of a small group of women that defied societal norms and walked “freely” in public spaces without a male escort.
This research study strives to answer the questions:
* How freely did Colette walk through streets of Paris?
* What streets did she frequent?
* Did she journey out past the quartier in which she lived in worked?

**Objects of Study & Analysis**
------------------------------

The main object of study will be Colette’s auto-fictional novel *The Vagabond*.
While Colette did not write openly about her personal life, she did so by writing herself as a fictional character.
*The Vagabond* in particular showcases Colette’s movements in Paris during the height of the Belle-Époque, when spaces where still segregated by gender.
In order to fact check sites mentioned in the work, I will also consult *Colette* a biography written by Elaine Marks.
I will also study interactive maps of Paris online, most likely through the use of Google Maps, to locate specific sites and movements.
This project will require a close reading of the text in order to pin point exact moments where movements and sites are mentioned in the work.

**Methods**
------------
I expect to use a close reading approach of *The Vagabond*.
After a close reading and the creation of a list of movements and places notes in the work, I will plot these points on an interactive map using an online platform.
I will also turn to literature on movement in Paris.
I will consult David Harvey’s *Paris, Capital of Modernity* and Deborah L Parson’s *Streetwalking the Metropolis: Women, the City, and Modernity*.
These texts will help determine areas that were considered *“off limits”* to women and which areas women were free to walk in in order to determine to what extent Colette did in fact defy societal norms on space.
Finally, I will turn to gispopsci.com as well as *GIS, spatial analysis and modeling* by DJ Maguire, Michael Batty and Michael Goodchild for resources, practices, and theories on different spatial analysis tools and software to use to conduct my research.

**Schedule and Timeline**
--------------------------
During the course of this project I aim to spend three weeks on conducting a close reading of the text and pulling points of analysis.
I will break the book into three parts, focusing one week on each part.
During the fourth week, I aim to begin the setup of my spatial analysis tool.
Within the following week my goal is to have the points of analysis plotted in order to analyze the location and movement around these plotted points.
